We welcome contributions to this open-source project. 

If you'd like to contribute to the main Siteglide Theme Module, the master branch is protected, so for new contributions, please create a new branch and create a pull request containing the changes you'd like to make.

If you'd like to build your own version of the module entirely, please create a fork and register as your own Module in the Siteglide Marketplace.

## Changelog

### 1.6.0

Fix for cookie popup layout not properly removing optional cookie scripts placed within Liquid logic. Remember changes will only apply to freshly installed layouts. If you need to fix an existing layout manually, replace: `{% if context.exports.company_information.properties.google_analytics_id != blank and context.exports.sitebuilder.cookie_preferences_js == 'all' %}` with `{% if context.exports.company_information.properties.google_analytics_id != blank and context.cookies['sg-cookie-policy-settings'] == 'all' %}`

### 1.5.0

Support for cookie preferences layouts.

### 1.4.0

Added dynamic API key fetching for textarea layout components. Requires SiteBuilder 4.7.2
### 1.3.0

- Improvements to forms
  - All form components to use the `{{field_id}}` (plus any appropriate suffix) for their ID, instead of name (same for label for attributes). This should simplify any JS or CSS referencing it.
  - All required fields will have an asterisk " *" added after their labels by default. This can be changed in components.
  - All inputs will be given data-attributes containing the text of their human-readable label `data-sg-validation-label` and the main field ID for their field `data-sg-validation-id` (note this may be different from the ID of the element if there are multiple form elements responsible for controlling a field, e.g. checkboxes). These can be useful when writing custom validation rules.
  - If the error message from Siteglide validation references a field by ID, we will change the error message to be more human-friendly. The default is a generic message asking the user to complete missing fields, but a commented out alternative allows you to print the human-readable name of the first missing field. Likewise, we've added a more human-friendly error message when a captcha fails. These messages can be edited in the form layout JS.
  - Improvements for Date, File and Image fields when marked as required.
  - Improvements for rich-text textarea type fields when marked as required.
  - Added minimum value to date fields so they do not add a date which is out of range of Siteglide's date field. Siteglide dates must be within the unix epoch.
  - Improved animation transition on form progress bars.

- Improvements to forms, adding easier paramter for setting custom redirects.

### 1.1.3

- Updated SCSS files to use /dist and /src folders.
- Improved Header Layout responsiveness
- Added LinkedIn to the Footer Layout

### 1.0.1
