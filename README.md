We welcome contributions to this open-source project. 

If you'd like to contribute to the main Siteglide Theme Module, the master branch is protected, so for new contributions, please create a new branch and create a pull request containing the changes you'd like to make. Don't forget to also update the changelog with what you have changed- list your new version number as "pending".

If you'd like to build your own version of the module entirely, please create a fork and register as your own Module in the Siteglide Marketplace.
